#summary Support options for questions and issues

= Module Support =

There is a [http://groups.google.com/group/simplesamlphp-googleapps Discussion Group] setup for questions that relate to the Google Apps module specifically. The SimpleSAMLphp community also has a well-established [http://groups.google.com/group/simplesamlphp Users mailing list] which can provide you with SimpleSAMLphp specific help.

If you find a bug with the Google Apps module, and have already discussed it on the Discussion Group, then file a [https://code.google.com/p/simplesamlphp-googleapps/issues/entry?template=Bug%20Report Bug Report]. Please do not use this for general questions/help though.
