# Module Support #

There is a [Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/simplesamlphp-googleapps) setup for questions that relate to the Google Apps module specifically. The SimpleSAMLphp community also has a well-established [Users mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/simplesamlphp) which can provide you with SimpleSAMLphp specific help.

If you find a bug with the Google Apps module, and have already discussed it on the Discussion Group, then file a [Bug Report](https://code.google.com/p/simplesamlphp-googleapps/issues/entry?template=Bug%20Report). Please do not use this for general questions/help though.

Another helpful tool is the SimpleSAMLphp log. This module is very verbose in the debugging messages. If you are having unexpected issues, set the log level to debug. Note: Any changes to Google Apps are logged as notice level.
